# Computer Graphics Challenges

This folder contains 7 challenges that use the `p5.js` and OpenGL libraries to create interactive graphics and visualizations.

## Challenges

The challenges in this folder are as follows:

- [Challenge 1:](/Computer_Graphics/Challenge_1/) A program in C++ that takes two points in the format (x, y) and returns a list of approximated points that represent a line segment.

- [Challenge 2:](/Computer_Graphics/Challenge_2/) A program using Processing that takes two points in the format (x, y) and returns a list of approximated points that represent a line segment, based on the given test cases.

- [Challenge 3:](/Computer_Graphics/Challenge_3/) A program using OpenGL that takes two points in the format (x, y) and returns a list of approximated points that represent a line segment, based on the given test cases.

- [Challenge 4:](/Computer_Graphics/Challenge_4/) A program that combines the concepts of primitives, user interfaces, interaction with the mouse, and the `p5.js` library to draw polygons.

- [Challenge 5:](/Computer_Graphics/Challenge_5/) A program using the `p5.js` library to implement the transformations of translation, rotation, and scaling.

- [Challenge 6:](/Computer_Graphics/Challenge_6/) A program using Processing to create a curve drawing application that allows the user to draw a line with the mouse, define control points, and move the control points with the mouse to create and modify a curve using supported curve functions in `p5.js`.

- [Challenge 7:](/Computer_Graphics/Challenge_7/) A program that creates an animation using the concepts of gravity, refresh rate, object deformation, timing, real-time animation, curve drawing algorithms, color, and texture, that simulates a bouncing ball.
